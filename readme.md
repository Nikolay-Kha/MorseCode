# MorseCode
This project was created to send and receive Morse Code, moslt for learning
purpose. But the most interesting part is that this Windows GUI application was
written with x86 assembler. It uses sound card for sending and receiving Morse
Code. You can setup different length of dots, dashes, pauses and tone frequency.
